![Arduino 101 with onboard LED blinking.](https://github.com/ckuzma/arduino-101-sketches/blob/master/photos/tapflash.gif)

## Description
A collection of sketches written specifically for the Arduino 101, taking advantage of the [Intel Curie](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wearables/wearable-soc.html)'s accelerometers and gyroscopes.

## Sketches
### tap-flash-test
The first test sketch written specifically for the Arduino 101. When a tap is detected, the onboard LED blinks.

### tap-beat-match
Synchronizes the flashing of lights to the beat of taps. Set the Arduino 101 on a table, wait for it to start its initial blink, then tap the table to a steady tempo for a few seconds. Stop tapping and the built-in LED will continue flashing at the same rate as your taps.

## Contest Acknowledgement
I was provided a Arduino 101 development board as part of my participation in the [*Arduino 101 - Invent Your Future!*](https://www.hackster.io/contests/Intel-Arduino-101) contest on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/). These sketches are being written as part of my project submission.
